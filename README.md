In this Assignment I made a Movie Review app, which fetched some data from JSON File (Can be edited to fetch from Server), and display it to users 

- Some Features of this Project:
    - Implemented Collapsable / Expandable CollectionView using diffabledatasource 
        - Why diffabledatasource? - As it has smooth transition as compared to normal method, and no need to Update or Reload the whole collectionview for minor changes
    - Search the Movie by Movie Name, Genre, Actor Name, Director Name etc (Can be edited easily to add more search filter)
    - Show all Movies filtered by any Category in Different Controller
    - A Different Controller to show all Details of Movie including Actors, Release Date, Plot, Genre etc
    - Also added a ActionSheet Controller which dynamically changed the data of tableview cell using UserDefault
